FRONTEND- MIDDLE-END- BACKEND

-we need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
-Using this middle-end ,when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should
actually respond this request
-we can do message validation,reesponse transformation,rate limiting
-we try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end
